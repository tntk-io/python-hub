# Resources to use

Below are some freely accessible resources for learning and practicing Python.

A great [Python roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/python) can be found here, that outlines the typical learning tree of
someone who wants to learn Python, along with the applicable resources.

## Learning platforms

* [SoloLearn](https://www.sololearn.com/en/learn/courses/python-developer) - a gamified platform focused on learning
the fundamentals of different programming languages, similarly to Duolingo for natural languages.
* [Scrimba](https://v2.scrimba.com/learn-python-c03) - a unique, interactive Python tutorial.
* [FutureCoder](https://futurecoder.io/course/#IntroducingTheShell) - a partly Python shell-based platform
that takes a very hands-on approach to teaching Python

# YouTube

* [Python Programming Beginner Tutorials - Corey Schafer](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTskrapNbzXhwoFUiLCjGgY7) - roughly 9 hours of videos, covering all of the fundamentals,

# Coding challenges

The following sites are mainly for practicing algorithms and data structures which might appear during job interviews as well.

* [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) - the most typical algorithm and data structure challenges, categorized into three tiers: easy, medium and hard.
* [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) - a community-driven platform for coding challenges.
The lower [kyu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ky%C5%AB) a challenge has the harder it is.
* [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) - challenges that get gradually harder
