# Python Hub

We are a DevOps school run by engineers with rich educational and professional credentials who've helped hundreds of students land tech jobs over the past 5 years. 

This repository is a collection of real-world coding interview cases for Cloud/DevOps/SRE roles, designed to help you build practical skills and confidence for your next big opportunity.

We host live, 2-hour instructor-led Zoom sessions every Saturday from 9 AM to 11 AM CT.

Scripts written during python-hub classes.

# Resources to use

Below are some freely accessible resources for learning and practicing Python.

A great [Python roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/python) can be found here, that outlines the typical learning tree of
someone who wants to learn Python, along with the applicable resources.

Another good choice is the [tutorial part of the official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html).
In this case, I recommend skipping the first two chapters and starting from chapter 3, since the first two chapters are about
setting up Python and some technical details. The tutorial can also be [downloaded in PDF format](https://docs.python.org/3/archives/python-3.13-docs-pdf-a4.zip)
(it's within the ZIP file under the name `tutorial.pdf`).

In many cases the documentation of different Python modules (both first and third party libraries) include a tutorial section too.

## Learning platforms

* [SoloLearn](https://www.sololearn.com/en/learn/courses/python-developer) - a gamified platform focused on learning
the fundamentals of different programming languages, similarly to Duolingo for natural languages.
* [Scrimba](https://v2.scrimba.com/learn-python-c03) - a unique, interactive Python tutorial.
* [FutureCoder](https://futurecoder.io/course/#IntroducingTheShell) - a partly Python shell-based platform.
that takes a very hands-on approach to teaching Python.

# YouTube

* [Python Programming Beginner Tutorials - Corey Schafer](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTskrapNbzXhwoFUiLCjGgY7) - roughly 9 hours of videos, covering all the fundamentals
* [Python Tutorial : Python Full Course - Derek Banas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1elmMBnykA) - TLDR style overview of Python.
* [Learn Python - Full Course for Beginners \[Tutorial\] - freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw)
* [Python for Beginners - Learn Python in 1 Hour - 
Programming with Mosh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqtD5dpn9C8) - the core fundamentals,
good for absolute beginners.
* [Python Tutorial - Python Full Course for Beginners - Programming with Mosh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc) -
a thorough overview of Python, covering virtually all the concepts you will need. The tutorial is 6 hours long but the most
important parts are all covered by hour 4.

# Coding challenges

The following sites are mainly for practicing algorithms and data structures which might appear during job interviews as well.

* [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) - the most typical algorithm and data structure challenges, categorized into three tiers: easy, medium and hard.
* [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) - a community-driven platform for coding challenges.
The lower [kyu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ky%C5%AB) a challenge has the harder it is.
* [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) - challenges that get gradually harder.
