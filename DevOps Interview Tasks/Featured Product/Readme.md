# Featured Products

If there is a tie for the product purchased most frequently, those product names are ordered alphabetically ascending and the last name in the list is chosen.

**Example**

products = *['redShirt', 'greenPants', 'redShirt', 'orangeShoes', 'blackPants', 'blackPants']*

* *greenPants* and *orangeShoes* were purchased once.
* *redShirt* and *blackPants* were each purchased 2 times on the given day.
* After ordering the products alphabetically ascending, *redShirt* is the last product listed.
* *redShirt* is the featured product for the following day.
