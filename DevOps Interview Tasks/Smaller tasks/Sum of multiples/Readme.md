# Sum of multiples

The function `compute_multiples_sum(n)` should return the sum of all the positive 
multiples of 3 or 5 or 7 strictly below n.
As an example, for `n=12` we get `3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10` as multiples
and the sum of these multiples is `40`.

The number 12 is a multiple of 3, but it is not added to the final sum
because we take only the numbers strictly below n.

Implement `compute_multiples_sum(n)`.
