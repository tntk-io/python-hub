# Scopes

## Global

Store user input in a variable called `text`.

Create a method called `edit_text` that allows the user to edit the text that they entered (by prompting the user again) without passing `text` as an argument.

Print the value of `text` after calling the `edit_text` function.

## Nonlocal

Create a function called `modify` that takes a parameter `x`.

Create another function called `square` that squares `x` without taking `x` as parameter.
The value of `x` should be changed after calling the function.

Call the function `square` within `modify` then print the value of `x`.
