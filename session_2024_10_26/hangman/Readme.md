# Hangman

Try to write a game like [hangman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)),
where the user has to guess the letters in a randomly selected world.

The player has some arbitrary number of incorrect guesses before losing the game,
you can either add an illustration (e.g. like [here](https://gist.github.com/chrishorton/8510732aa9a80a03c829b09f12e20d9c))
or simply display how many guesses are left.

It's also a good idea to show the already guessed incorrect letters
so that the user can keep track of what they already guessed better.

Optionally, try to create a simple menu, where you have different options (e.g. new game, statistics and exit).

Besides the main functionalities, try to add meaningful logging to the game.
